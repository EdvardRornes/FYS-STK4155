\maketitle

\section*{Why did you choose this course?}
\noindent
I have always been interested in learning machine learning. I've also considered it something which could be useful if/when applying for jobs.

\section*{What was your programming knowledge before you started?}
I was fairly confident in python, and somewhat good in c++ before starting this course. This course did not teach me much new in terms of pure programin knowledge.

\section*{How do you judge your own level of knowledge on machine learning before and after this course?}
I feel like I was a good overview of the subject and understand the key concepts of machine learning. We have been able to implement linear/logisitc regression models and neural networks from scratch, but also with the use of libraries such as keras.
